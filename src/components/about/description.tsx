        in computer engineering. Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working for a startup
        and a healthcare IT company, teaching me much about the cloud, and
        software engineering in general. <br />

        My main focus is learning and building products and projects utilizing
        the latest technologies, and furthering my skills as a developer and
